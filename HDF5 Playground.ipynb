The notebook will be filled with a lot of code accompanied by comments mentioning some important concept, intuition. To finish the book faster and get as much content as possible in the notebook I won't be giving the background for the HDF5 file format and other high level theoretical details which can be found in the book or other pages online but focus more on practical aspect of coding in Python and using HDF5 for storing scientific data.\n",

The fast moving dimension is the last dimension (of size 640) and is the one whose values are stored continuously.
